I am a PhD candidate and teaching assistant at TU/e, The Netherlands. 

I am currently interested in developing methods that enable deep neural networks to continually learn stream of tasks with changing distribution over time.  I am practicually interested in methods that address the Stability-Plasticity dilemma with constrained capacity models and limited/no access to previously seen data.  I believe this enables developing intelligent agents applicable to real-world applications where memory and computation constraints should be considered.
